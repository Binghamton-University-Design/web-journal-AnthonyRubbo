		<p> For my digital story project I would like to make a documentary website based on the story of Cicada 3301. It is believed to be the most “elaborated and mysterious puzzle of the internet age“.The name Cicada 3301 is given to a mysterious organization that has posted sets of puzzles to recruit the fastest and most intelligent code breakers from all over the world. This puzzle was initially posted on sites like Reddit and 4chan and ran for nearly a month until the first puzzle was solved. The puzzle stated: </p>

		<p>The whole story of Cicada 3301 is nothing less than a puzzle itself. The more people that tried to research it, the more ambiguity they found. The first wave of puzzles suddenly stopped, making people think either the puzzler gave up as he couldn't find a suitable recruit or he found what he was after.</p>

		<p>But oddly enough, after one year a different set of disturbing puzzles surfaced over the deep web. In the final round of which people saw the same signature image as used by cicada 3301. Thus confirming it was the same. However the puzzles suddenly​ stopped again and we have not heard anything from the puzzler so far since then.</p>

		<p>Some anonymous users on Reddit and 4chan claim to have reached the final round and at the end were interviewed by a robotic voice. Some confess they have worked with the whole group for sometime. Some went on saying that they left the so-called elite group as the whole cult was dedicated to perform inhuman acts on the dark web. But they could be easily lying. There is no way to know.</p>

		<p>In my opinion the puzzler got what he was after, it's hard to believe that somebody who took pains of planting clues all over the world and using multi-layered encryption in his puzzles will abandon the whole project so easily. The experts agree that puzzler found his recruits and they were told to remain anonymous as any cult does to its members.</p>

		<h2>Structure</h2>

		<p>The structure of my website will be a sequence linking strategy where one page links to the next, there will be no sort of randomness or other paths to take. This will help me to explain the story behind Cicada 3301 without worrying about the viewer getting confused. At any point the viewer could go back to the previous page.</p>

		<p>The process of the website would first start by explaining the upbringing of Cicada 3301 and where the first clue was posted in 2012. Then next would be the explanation of how the clue was solved, this will be explained with text, images, animated visuals, and recordings. This order would continue for all 3 of the clues posted by the puzzler.</p>

		<p>The scavenger hunt had many in-depth puzzles that tunneled to other clues, some of these clues led to telephone numbers, original music, bootable Linux CDs, digital images, physical paper signs, and pages of unpublished cryptic books written in runes, and geographic coordinates. I will add all of these details to my digital story to make the website more interactive. The viewer will be able to click on different elements on the screen to call the phone number, play the audio recording, locate the coordinates on the map etc…</p>

		<p>On each page of the website, I will explain how each puzzle was solved with a timeline of all the progress. Toward the end of the story I will explain the many theories on what cicada 3301 was trying to achieve with this project and the cult-like behavior of the private group.</p>
