        <h1 style="font-size: 300%;">The Depths Of The Ocean</h1>

        <h2><big>Brief</big></h2>
		
		<p>The goal for my digital story is to create a website which informs users on the depth layers of the ocean and what types of creatures and air pressure you would find at those layers. The ocean is extremely deep and not many realize the almost otherworldly creatures that live at these depths. My digital story will help the viewer to understand not only the size of these creatures to us humans, but also how these sea creatures are able to live at such low depths. It's obvious that the deeper you get in the ocean the less light there is, I would like to explain how these creatures live and are able to survive with little to no vision whatsoever. I would also explain how these creatures have evolved to be able to survive in such high pressure depths. </p>

		<p>In my opinion the puzzler got what he was after, it's hard to believe that somebody who took pains of planting clues all over the world and using multi-layered encryption in his puzzles will abandon the whole project so easily. The experts agree that puzzler found his recruits and they were told to remain anonymous as any cult does to its members.</p>

		<h2>Structure</h2>

		<p>The narrative for the website would be a sequence strategy where the user would continually scroll down the webpage to enter the next layer of the ocean. The further you scroll down on the page would correspond to the depth levels of the ocean.</p>

		<h2>Layout</h2>

		<p>The layout of the website would be as follows: To start, the first scene would be a two dimensional view that shows both surface land and the ocean sea level, in this would also be a submarine floating just under the sea level. There will also be a scuba diver next to the submarine to give a sense of scale. On the left-hand side of the page would be a measuring tool which displays the psi of the ocean layer and how many meters down you are. While scrolling down The background gradient would become darker to show how light is affected by the water. This color gradient would become black at the aphotic zone (water layer where there is no visible sunlight) of the water. There will be animations of sea creatures scaled next to the submarine and informative text on what aquatic life you would find living there and information on the ocean layer itself.</p>
